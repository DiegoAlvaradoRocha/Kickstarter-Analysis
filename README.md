## Overview of Project

### Purpose: In this project we want to help Louis find how different campaigns fared in relation to their Launch date and their Goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: 
-	Pivot Table is really useful on this part of the analysis and their Pivot Chart let us visualize better the outcomes of the data on Launch Date.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
-	When you are using the Pivot table make sure to choose well the different items and also pick the filters that you need to get better results and a better visualization
-	Make sure to doble check the formula and its data and cells are fixed when needed.
-	In the char make sure that the data is showing what you want. I have to use Format Chart Area to show a better chart for my visualization

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-	May and June were the months with better Outcomes with higher number of successful projects but also Failed projects too.
-	November and December were the lower outcomes for Successful and failed while for canceled were October.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-	The Goal range between 1000 and 5000 were the bigger number of projects. We can see that no project were canceled and also for this reason the chart show as an inversely proportional relationship between successful and failed.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
-	That we donâ€™t have data of the number of user and some basic data of them.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-	We try to visualize the numbers of projects by Country by a Pie Chart to see other opportunities across the world.
